alignment_handlers.py
Part of Rail-RNA

Includes various functions for handling alignments output by Bowtie2 -- most
importantly:
-a function that outputs indels, junctions, exons, and mismatches from a genome
position, CIGAR string, and MD string (indels_junctions_exons_mismatches)
-a function that inserts junctions in a CIGAR string (multread_with_junctions).

        An alignment takes the form of a line of SAM.
        Junctions are encoded in a multiread's RNAME as follows:

        original RNAME + '+' or '-' indicating which strand is the sense
        strand + '\x1d' + start position of sequence + '\x1d' + comma-separated
        list of subsequence sizes framing introns + '\x1d' + comma-separated
        list of intron sizes.

        If there are no junctions present, the multiread's RNAME takes the
        following form:
        original RNAME + '\x1d' + start position of sequence + '\x1d\x1d'

        More than one alignment output by Bowtie may correspond to the same
        alignment in reference space because at least two reference names in
        the junction Bowtie index contained overlapping bases. In this case,
        the alignments are collapsed into a single alignment. If an alignment
        is found to overlap junctions, the XS:A:('+' or '-') field is appended
        to indicate which strand is the sense strand. An NH:i:(integer) field
        is also added to each alignment to indicate the number of alignments.
        These extra fields are used by Cufflinks.

            from a line of SAM representing an alignment.
